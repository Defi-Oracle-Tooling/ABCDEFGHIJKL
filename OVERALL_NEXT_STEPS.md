# Overall Next Steps

1. **Script Verification**
   - Run from the CLI:
     - `pnpm lint`
     - `pnpm format`
     - `pnpm test`
     - `pnpm build`
   - Ensure there are no errors or regressions.

2. **Complete Test Suite**
   - Run the full test suite locally.
   - Confirm that the CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) passes all tests.

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - As you add new components or features, update:
     - README.md (for usage, scripts, and workflows)
     - CONTRIBUTING.md (for guidelines and workflow updates)
   - Include any new API references, architecture diagrams, or developer guides.

4. **Expand Unit Tests**
   - Add additional tests for components like ConfigWizard and ErrorBoundary.
   - Cover edge cases and error handling scenarios for robust test coverage.

5. **Accessibility Monitoring**
   - Use tools such as axe-core to identify accessibility issues in the UI.
   - Address any accessibility-related improvements.

6. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Investigate and, if appropriate, implement performance strategies:
     - Code splitting
     - Lazy-loading of components
   - Monitor overall application performance as the project scales.

7. **Ongoing Reviews**
   - Regularly review and update the Code of Conduct and contribution guidelines.
   - Incorporate feedback from contributors and pull requests.

Use this checklist as a living document to guide your projectâ€™s ongoing maintenance and improvements.
